  # This workflow takes three sets of measurements â€” one for the current commit,

  # and another against a consistent version that is used as a baseline measurement.
  # This is done to isolate variance in measurements caused by the GitHub runners
  # from differences caused by code changes between commits. The BASE_TAG value here
  # represents the version being used for baseline measurements. It should only be
  # changed if we want to normalize results against a different baseline.
