    Comments: Use a more precise check for disallowed keys on filtered comment data.
    
    The previous approach of running `wp_allow_comment()` twice could have unintended consequences, e.g. the `check_comment_flood` action was also triggered twice, which might lead to false-positive identification of comment flood in case there is some custom callback hooked to it, which is not expecting identical data seeing twice.
    
    This commit introduces a new function, `wp_check_comment_data()`, to specifically check for disallowed content before and after comment data is filtered.
    
    Follow-up to [59267].

    Global styles: preload `/global-styles` endpoint responses
    
    This commit fixes a regression whereby requests to global styles endpoints were not being preloaded, resulting in several requests being fired clientside unnecessarily.
    
    For performance reasons, we  preload the requests so that the data is in the editor store and ready to use straight away.
    
    The outcome is that the editor loads more quickly.

    HTML API: Fix extensibility of `WP_HTML_Processor::next_token()`.
    
    Break out logic from the `next_token()` method into a private method which may call itself recursively. This allows for subclasses to override the `next_token()` method and be assured that each call to `next_token()` corresponds with the consumption of one single token. This also parallels how `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor::next_token()` wraps a private `base_class_next_token()` method.

Author: Jonathan Desrosiers <desrosj@git.wordpress.org>
Date:   Wed Oct 23 00:05:55 2024 +0000

    Build/Test Tools: Add MySQL 8.4 support to the Docker environment.
    
    Because `caching_sha2_password` is not supported on PHP 7.2 & 7.3, the local Docker environment has used the `--default-authentication-plugin` system variable to always make use of `mysql_native_password` despite MySQL 8.0 deprecating this auth plugin.
    
    However in MySQL 8.4, the `--default-authentication-plugin` option was removed in favor of `--authentication-policy`, and `mysql_native_password` is now disabled by default. `mysql_native_password` has also been removed in MySQL 9.0.
    
    This change adds support to the local Docker environment for MySQL 8.4 by adding some helper functions that determine which authentication plugin should be used based on the configured PHP/MySQL versions and automatically making the necessary configuration adjustments.

    Comments: Validate new comments before and after comment data is filtered.
    
    This ensures that a Disallowed Comment Keys match will consistently send the comment to the Trash, by checking both the original unmodified comment data and the final filtered comment data.
    
    If the first check has already resulted in a `trash` or `spam` status, the second check is skipped as redundant.

    Menus: A11y: Set the parent and order using select fields.
    
    Add `select` inputs to allow users to set the parent and position of items in the menu settings. Fixes a significant problem for screen reader users that makes updating menus extremely tedious, since the options for moving items do not explicitly set a position. This is also a significant improvement for all users manipulating large menus.
    
    This could easily be considered an enhancement, but while it is a minor enhancement for most users, it is transformative for screen reader users in managing menus, moving that interface from nearly unusable to very manageable.

    Build/Test Tools: Refine `paths` filter for workflows part 2.
    
    [59252] made the path filtering a bit too broad for the Test Old Branches workflow.
    
    Though `v3` of the reusable PHPUnit workflow is used by some older branches, this version is updated much more frequently because itâs the latest version.
    
    To limit the number of times this workflow runs, old branches should only be tested when old versions of the workflow are updated.

    Build/Test Tools: Refine `paths` filter for workflows.
    
    Some GitHub Action workflows use the `paths` filter to limit when workflows run for pull requests. This helps avoid running workflows unnecessarily when the pull request does not change any relevant code.
    
    Currently, a few of these workflows are configured to run when any `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory is changed. This updates those workflows to target more specific workflow files for more efficient running.
    
    See #61564.

    Tests: Correct test class name for `rss_enclosure()` as per the naming conventions.
    
    Includes:
    * Moving `@covers` tags to the class-level DocBlock, since this is the only function tested in the class.
    * Adjusting the assertion messages for clarity, as `rss_enclosure()` does not return anything directly.
    * Using a static closure for improved performance.

    Media: Account for post ID queries in `update_post_thumbnail_cache()`.
    
    Updates `update_post_thumbnail_cache()` to account for `WP_Query` objects that only contain the post ID field rather than the entire post object.
    
    This changes passes the `$post` value to `get_post_thumbnail_id()` rather than assuming the presence of the ID property. Additionally, the posts to which the thumbnail is attached are now primed prior to calling the function to avoid numerous unnecessary database queries.
    
    The test `WP_Test_REST_Posts_Controller::test_get_items_primes_parent_post_caches()` is modified to account for an order of operations change for the priming of post meta caches. The cache is no longer primed in the final call to `update_meta_cache()` so the tests need to account for the post meta to be primed in any call to the function.

    Build/Test Tools: Move `composer update` to `env:start`.
    
    Currently, `composer update` is run whenever `test:php` is called to ensure the latest versions of `yoast/phpunit-polyfills` and other dependencies are always installed when running the PHPUnit test suite.
    
    For contributors using the local Docker environment to run tests during development, this is unnecessary and can often result in a 30+ second delay every time `test:php` is called.
    
    This moves the command to `env:install`, reducing the number of times `composer update` is run from many to once. Since the environment needs to be started in order to run tests, `env:install` will still confirm that the latest versions of required dependencies are installed and available prior to running the test suite.

    Themes: Improve performance of applying background image styles in `theme.json`.
    
    The cost of using `WP_Theme_JSON::get_block_nodes()` for this in its original shape was high enough to lead to a performance regression. Therefore this changeset introduces a new option on the method that allows to bypass all logic except for retrieving the node paths, which is much faster and everything that this functionality needs.

    Build/Test Tools: Temporarily ignore Slack failures.
    
    When many workflows are initiated at the same time, there are often instances where the requests to Slack providing updates are rate limited. This usually happens when the Test Old Branches workflow runs and initiates testing for all workflows in branches that could potentially receive a security update.
    
    Even though everything was successful in the workflow except the message, the workflow run is marked as failed. The next time the same workflow runs for that branch, a âfixedâ message will be sent to `#core` in Slack. The result is a burst of messages that is quite noisy and unnecessary.
    
    This temporarily adds `continue-on-error` to the jobs responsible for sending the messages until a better solution can be decided on.
    
    See #61701.

    Build/Test Tools: Configure npm to `prefer-dedupe`.
    
    `npm dedupe` is a command that attempts to simplify the structure of the local package tree by moving dependencies higher up. This allows for more effective package sharing, less transfer, and smaller `node_modules` folders.
    
    This change configures npm to `prefer-dedupe` by default so that these benefits persist and the command is not required to be run regularly.
    
    This also brings better alignment with the Gutenberg repository, which has already configured `prefer-dedupe`.

    Build/Test Tools: Update npm lockfile to version 3.
    
    This updates the `package-lock.json` file to use the version 3 format.
    
    Version 3 removes the version 1 format data, resulting in a smaller file. While version 3 format is not supported in npm < 7, a lower limit is enforced in the `engines` declaration within `package.json` and has been >= 7 since [56378].
    
    The Gutenberg repository has already been updated to use version 3.

    Media: Cache the results of _wp_image_editor_choose.
    
    This saves the `WP_Image_Editor` implementation that supports the queried options to a cache to avoid performing redundant compatibility checks, which can be expensive. For example, `WP_Image_Editor_Imagick::supports_mime_type()` can get called in the editor multiple times to determine which image formats can be supported during `wp_plupload_default_settings()`.
    
    With this cache, the support will be stored for 1 day, speeding up loading times for the editor. This also introduces a new global caching group, `image_editor` to manage any subsequent caches that are related to image editor optimizations.

    Editor: A11y: Fix tab order, state, and focus in classic editor.
    
    Remove code that forced focus to skip from the title field to the editor. Add link to skip to editor to give the user control over their path. Set `aria-pressed` on editor selector buttons to communicate which editor is enabled. Make focus state visible on unselected editor button. Remove `wp_keep_scroll_position` flag used for IE compatibility. Add `role="presentation"` to table used as status info bar.
    
    This addresses a long-standing accessibility problem in the classic editor which created a confusing keyboard navigation path by skipping all content between the title field and the content editor.

    WP_Debug_Data: Extract `wp-plugins` data into separate methods.
    
    This is the eighth part in a larger modularization of the data in `WP_Debug_Data`. Previously this was a single massive method drawing in debug data from various groups of related data, where the groups were independent from each other.
    
    This patch separates the eighth and ninth of twelve groups, the `wp-plugins-active` and `wp-plugins-inactive` info, into separate methods focused on that data.
    
    Unlike the other patches in this series, the plugins data comes from a single source and is separated out into separate debug sections, so the active and inactive methods call a new shared method which provides raw data for both. Optimizations and refactors may occur in follow-up tickets.

    Bootstrap/Load: Prevent loopback scraping errors when there is no key or nonce.
    
    For error detection and rollback functions WordPress also starts a loopback request to the homepage. This loopback request is made with special parameters that when they don't match, generates an erorr. This hardens that flow by exiting out of the check if the nonce or key is missing or the nonce is not saved in the DB. It further hardens it by not caching the failures and asking search engines not to index the url with the failures.

    Build/Test Tools: Resolve access failure to continue sending commit performance data to Code Vitals dashboard.
    
    This originally broke in [58165] and unfortunately went unnoticed for a while because the failing request to send the data did not cause the GitHub workflows to fail. This changeset resolves the underlying access problem, which was happening because reusable GitHub workflows do not automatically receive secrets from the calling workflow. More concretely, the relevant `CODEVITALS_PROJECT_TOKEN` was not being explicitly passed to the reusable workflow.
    
    The changeset also includes a change so that in the future a failing request would cause the workflow to fail, which ensures a similar problem further down the road wouldn't go unnoticed.

    Build/Test Tools: Enable testing for PHP 8.4.
    
    With PHP 8.4 due out in November later this year, contributors have been working on ensuring WordPress 6.7 is as compatible as possible. Enough progress has been made during this release cycle where PHPUnit tests now run successfully with no failures reported.
    
    This change enables PHP 8.4 testing throughout Coreâs GitHub Action workflows to ensure no new problems are introduced going forward.
    
    There are two exceptions to this:
    - The Importer plugin has some compatibility issues that produce test failures. There is an open pull request upstream, but these problematic tests have been marked skipped when running on PHP 8.4 until that PR is merged.
    - Since no stable versions of xDebug with PHP 8.4 support have been published, these tests are also skipped for now.

    In most cases, running the installation testing workflow in forked repositories is unnecessary and wasteful. This adds conditions to that workflow to prevent the tests from running on forks unless a pull request is being made back to that fork.

    In ongoing work to modularize the `WP_Debug_Data` class, several methods were added with `public` visibility. This patch sets the new methods to `private` as a measure to ensure optionality as the changes progress, since it's easier to move from private to public than the other way around.

    Administration: Switch core post type labels to `add_new_item`.
    
    In [56515], the default value of `Add New` was changed to "Add New Post / Add New Page". This caused problems with post types where `add_new` was not declared.
    
    Change core usage to reference the `add_new_item` value and revert the default value of `add_new` back to "Add New / Add New". This retains the accessibility advantages without creating counter intuitive usage of the `add_new` key.
    
    With this change, post types registered with no `add_new` key will be unimpacted in core, and post types registered with no `add_new_item` key will use the default "Add New Post", which is not a change from the current state.

    General: Expand use of `wp_get_wp_version()`.
    
    Expands the use of `wp_get_wp_version()` to get an unmodified value of the current WordPress version in various locations in which it would be unhelpful if a plugin has modified the global `$wp_version`.
    
    This includes:
    
    * Theme and plugin compatibility tests
    * During the upgrade process of WP Core
    * Debug and site health data reports of the current version
    * Version number display in the dashboard
    * Block theme export and caching utilities
    * The `WPDB` class

    I18N: Do not load translations directly in `load_*_textdomain`.
    
    In [59127], `_doing_it_wrong` warnings were added if plugins or themes load translations too early, either through a manual function call or just-in-time loading.
    
    Because many plugins and themes still manually call `load_plugin_textdomain()`, `load_theme_textdomain()` or `load_muplugin_textdomain()`, even though they don't have to anymore, that caused a lot of warnings.
    
    With this new approach, these functions merely register the translations path in the existing `WP_Textdomain_Registry` and do not immediately try to load the translations anymore. The loading is all handled by the just-in-time functionality.
    
    This way, warnings will only be emitted if triggering the just-in-time loading too early, greatly improving the developer experience and to a degree also performance.

    * Simplifying the logic and bringing some consistency to how the values are checked and displayed.
    * Correcting the debug value for `DB_COLLATE`. This should be the actual contents of the constant, and empty if it is indeed empty, as the debug data that's copied and shared should represent the raw value, and does not need to be in a user-readable format.

    Script Modules: prevent broken links by using includes_url.
    
    [59083] introduced an issue where Script Modules registered src does not correctly respect the includes path.
    
    Before that change, script modules were registered using includes_url. The patch used a hard-coded path which breaks when sites are not served from the root, e.g. the site root is https://example.com/wp instead of https://example.com/.

    External Libraries: Update the SimplePie library to version 1.8.0.
    
    The most notable change in this update is that all code is now namespaced and uses PSR-4 classes, though there is a compatibility layer available for extenders using the older class names, so plugin or theme authors directly using SimplePie can decide for themselves when they want to change to using the namespaced names for SimplePie classes.
    
    Note: This commit includes additional fixes for PHP 8.4 compatibility ([https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/pull/875 PR 875], [https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/pull/888 PR 888]) from the `one-dot-eight` branch of SimplePie, which is expected to be [https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/pull/886 released as SimplePie 1.8.1] soon.

    Editor: Allow registering PHP manifest file for block metadata collections for enhanced performance.
    
    Typically, when registering a new block type, its metadata is read from the provided `block.json` file. The more block types are registered on a site, the more costly becomes this process, as it involves filesystem reads and parsing JSON.
    
    WordPress Core's built-in blocks have in the past worked around that by having a auto-generated PHP manifest file that includes the already parsed JSON data for all blocks. This changeset effectively allows plugins to do the same, by introducing a new API function `wp_register_block_metadata_collection()`. The WordPress Core block manifest is now handled using this API as well, rather than custom logic baked into `register_block_type_from_metadata()`.
    
    The `wp_register_block_metadata_collection()` function requires two parameters:
    * `$path`: The base path in which block files for the collection reside.
    * `$manifest`: The path to the manifest file for the collection.
    
    Every `block.json` file that is supposed to be part of the collection must reside within the provided `$path`, within its own block-specific directory matching the block name (without the block namespace). For example, for a collection `$path` of `/wp-content/plugins/test-plugin` and a block `test-plugin/testimonial`, the block file could be `/wp-content/plugins/test-plugins/blocks/testimonial/block.json`.
    
    It is recommended that plugins use the new API function for enhanced performance, especially if they register several block types. However, the use of the function is entirely optional. Not using it will not result in any difference in user-facing behavior.

    Interactivity API: Add `wp_interactivity_get_element()` function.
    
    Introduces the `wp_interactivity_get_element()` function to the Interactivity API, analogous to the `getElement()` function in the `@wordpress/interactivity` JavaScript module. This function allows access to the current element being processed during directive processing.
    
    The function returns an array containing the `attributes` property, which includes only the originally defined attributes present on the element. Attributes added or modified by directive processing are not included. This is intended for use in derived state properties inside `wp_interactivity_state()`, similar to how `wp_interactivity_get_context()` is used.
    
    Example usage:
    
    ```php
    wp_interactivity_state( 'myPlugin', array(
        'buttonText' => function() {
            $context = wp_interactivity_get_context();
            $element = wp_interactivity_get_element();
            return isset( $context['buttonText'] )
              ? $context['buttonText']
              : $element['attributes']['data-default-button-text'];
        },
    ) );
    ```
    
    Includes unit tests to cover the new functionality.

    Interactivity API: Move interactivity-router i18n strings to Script Module data.
    
    Moves the 'loading' and 'loaded' i18n strings for the `interactivity-router` to the script module data via the `script_module_data_@wordpress/interactivity-router` filter.
    
    Key changes:
    
    - Add the `filter_script_module_interactivity_router_data()` method, hooked into the `script_module_data_@wordpress/interactivity-router` filter, to set the `i18n` data with the 'loading' and 'loaded' messages.
    - Rename the `print_router_loading_and_screen_reader_markup()` method to `print_router_markup()` and remove the screen reader markup from it because it's no longer needed.
    - Deprecate the `print_router_loading_and_screen_reader_markup()` method.
    - Remove the `loading` and `loaded` strings from the `core/router` store state because they're no longer needed.
    - Initialize the `core/router` store with a minimal navigation object to prevent errors in the interactivity-router script module when the store is not properly initialized.
    - Update corresponding unit tests to reflect these changes.
    
    This change ensures that the `interactivity-router` i18n messages are localized in a single place and removes the need to initialize them in the `core/router` store state.

    I18N: Emit warnings if loading translations too early.
    
    Some plugins and themes load translations too early, before the current user is known.
    This happens either explicitly or through just-in-time translation loading.
    
    If the current user (and thus their locale) is not known, WordPress might attempt to load translations in the wrong locale.
    
    This change adds `_doing_it_wrong` messages to warn about such cases. It also helps avoiding accidentally trying to load translations twice (once just-in-time and once manually).
    
    Projects triggering such a message are encourage to load translations no earlier than the `after_setup_theme` hook.

    Block Hooks: Respect `"multiple": false` in hooked blocks.
    
    If a prospective hooked block has its `multiple` block-supports field set to `false` (thus allowing only one instance of the block to be present), ensure that:
    
    1. Only one instance of the block will be inserted if it's not yet present in the current context.
    2. The block will not be inserted at all if an instance of it is already present in the current context.
    
    As always in Block Hooks parlance, "context" denotes the containing template, template part, pattern, or navigation post that a hooked block is supposed to be inserted into.
    
    The markup of a webpage that uses a Block Theme typically comprises a number of such contexts -- one template and any number of template parts, patterns, and navigation posts. Note that the limitation imposed by this changeset only applies on a per-context basis, so it's still possible that the resulting page contains more than one instance of a hooked block with `"multiple": false` set, as each context could contribute up to one such instance.

    General: Remove `noopener` from links opening in a new tab.
    
    Removes the automatic addition of `rel="noopener noreferrer"` from links targeting a new tab or window, `target='_blank'`. Since this was introduced, supported browsers have changed their security policies and no longer allow the opened link to have JavaScript access to the previous tab.
    
    Deprecates:
    
    * `wp_targeted_link_rel()`
    * `wp_targeted_link_rel_callback()`
    * `wp_init_targeted_link_rel_filters()`: converted to a noop function
    * `wp_remove_targeted_link_rel_filters()`: converted to a noop function
    
    The deprecated functions are retained in `formatting.php` as in `SHORTINIT` mode the file is included while `deprecated.php` is not.
    
    This also removes the `noopener` from links hard coded within the WordPress dashboard linking to documentation and other resources.

    Code Modernization: Fix trigger_error() with E_USER_ERROR deprecation in TestXMLParser::parse().
    
    PHP 8.4 deprecates the use of `trigger_errror()` with `E_USER_ERROR` as the error level, as there are a number of gotchas to this way of creating a `Fatal Error` (`finally` blocks not executing, destructors not executing).
    The recommended replacements are either to use exceptions or to do a hard `exit`.
    
    As this is a test-only class, do not have to take BC-breaks into account.
    
    Also, as this is a test helper, throwing a exception is the most appropriate solution.

    Code Modernization: Fix trigger_error() with E_USER_ERROR deprecation in WP_Test_Stream::open().
    
    PHP 8.4 deprecates the use of `trigger_errror()` with `E_USER_ERROR` as the error level, as there are a number of gotchas to this way of creating a `Fatal Error` (`finally` blocks not executing, destructors not executing).
    The recommended replacements are either to use exceptions or to do a hard `exit`.
    
    As this is a test-only class, do not have to take BC-breaks into account.
    
    Also, as this is a test helper, throwing a exception is the most appropriate solution.

    Code Modernization: Fix trigger_error() with E_USER_ERROR deprecation in wp_trigger_error().
    
    PHP 8.4 deprecates the use of `trigger_errror()` with `E_USER_ERROR` as the error level, as there are a number of gotchas to this way of creating a `Fatal Error` (`finally` blocks not executing, destructors not executing). The recommended replacements are either to use exceptions or to do a hard `exit`.
    
    WP has its own `wp_trigger_error()` function, which under the hood calls `trigger_error()`. If passed `E_USER_ERROR` as the `$error_level`, this will hit the PHP 8.4 deprecation.
    
    Now, there were basically three options:
    * Silence the deprecation until PHP 9.0 and delay properly solving this until then. This would lead to an awkward solution, as prior to PHP 8.0, error silencing would apply to all errors, while, as of PHP 8.0, it will no longer apply to fatal errors. It also would only buy us some time and wouldn't actually solve anything.
    
    * Use `exit($status)` when `wp_trigger_error()` is called with `E_USER_ERROR`. This would make the code untestable and would disable handling of these errors via custom error handlers, which makes this an undesirable solution.
    
    * Throw an exception when `wp_trigger_error()` is called with `E_USER_ERROR`. This makes for the most elegant solution with the least BC-breaking impact, though it does open it up to the error potential being "caught" via a `try-catch`. That's not actually a bad thing and is likely to only happen for those errors which can be worked around, in which case, it's a bonus that that's now possible.
    
    The third option is implemented which:
    * Introduces a new `WP_Exception` class.
    * Starts using `WP_Exception` in the `wp_trigger_error()` function when the `$error_level` is set to `E_USER_ERROR`.
    
    This change is covered by pre-existing tests, which have been updated to expect the exception instead of a PHP error.
    
    Why not use `WP_Error`?
    
    Well, for one, this would lead to completely different behaviour (BC).
    
    As `WP_Error` doesn't extend `Exception`, the program would not be stopped, but would continue running, which would be a much bigger breaking change and carries security risks. `WP_Error` also doesn't natively trigger displaying/logging of the error message, so in that case, it would still need an `exit` with the error message, bringing us back to point 2 above.
    
    Introducing `WP_Exception` provides (essentially) the same behaviour in that it retains the fatal error and error message displaying/logging behaviors. It also introduces a base Exception class, from which future exception classes can extend.

    Code Modernization: Fix trigger_error() with E_USER_ERROR deprecation in Text_Diff_Op::reverse().
    
    PHP 8.4 deprecates the use of `trigger_errror()` with `E_USER_ERROR` as the error level, as there are a number of gotchas to this way of creating a `Fatal Error` (`finally` blocks not executing, destructors not executing).
    The recommended replacements are either to use exceptions or to do a hard `exit`.
    
    This is an unmaintained external dependency; thus, the fix is made in the WP specific copy of the dependency.
    
    As `trigger_error()` call looks to be a remnant of the PHP 4 era before a class could be declared as `abstract`, fixed by making both the method as well as the class `abstract` and removing the call to `trigger_error()`.

    Block Hooks: `apply_block_hooks_to_content` in Patterns, Templates.
    
    In the Patterns registry, use `apply_block_hooks_to_content` (introduced in [58291])  instead of the `WP_Block_Patterns_Registry` class's private `get_content` method. (The latter is removed as part of this changeset.)
    
    In a similar vein, use `apply_block_hooks_to_content` in the `_build_block_template_result_from_file` and `_build_block_template_result_from_post` functions, respectively.
    
    For that to work, `apply_block_hooks_to_content` is amended to inject the `theme` attribute into Template Part blocks, even if no hooked blocks are present.
    
    This kind of centralization is required as a preparation for #61902.

    WP_Debug_Data: Extract `wp-dropins` data into separate method.
    
    This is the seventh part in a larger modularization of the data in `WP_Debug_Data`. Previously this was a single massive method drawing in debug data from various groups of related data, where the groups were independent from each other.
    
    This patch separates the seventh of twelve groups, the `wp-dropins` info, into a separate method focused on that data.
    
    This work precedes changes to make the `WP_Debug_Data` class more extensible for better use by plugin and theme code.

    HTML API: Switch to HTML namespace when entering Integration Points.
    
    When encountering inline SVG and MathML content in an HTML document, there are certain "integration points" which transition back into the HTML parsing ruleset. Previously, the HTML API was incorrectly switching into the namespace of the element transitioning into that ruleset.
    
    In this patch, the correct transition is made, where all integration points refer to HTML rules, while non-integration points refer to the rules of the namespace corresponding to the token itself.

    Interactivity API: Move interactivity-router i18n strings to Script Module data.
    
    Moves the 'loading' and 'loaded' i18n strings for the `interactivity-router` to the script module data via the `script_module_data_@wordpress/interactivity-router` filter.
    
    Key changes:
    
    - Add the `filter_script_module_interactivity_router_data()` method, hooked into the `script_module_data_@wordpress/interactivity-router` filter, to set the `i18n` data with the 'loading' and 'loaded' messages.
    - Rename the `print_router_loading_and_screen_reader_markup()` method to `print_router_markup()` and remove the screen reader markup from it because it's no longer needed.
    - Remove the `loading` and `loaded` strings from the `core/router` store state because they're no longer needed.
    - Initialize the `core/router` store with a minimal navigation object to prevent errors in the interactivity-router script module when the store is not properly initialized.
    - Update corresponding unit tests to reflect these changes.
    
    This change ensures that the `interactivity-router` i18n messages are localized in a single place and removes the need to initialize them in the `core/router` store state.

    Build/Test Tools: Check if the WordPress Importer plugin is installed in test bootstrap.
    
    If a hard requirement for the test suite is not fulfilled, running the tests should be blocked from the test bootstrap. A test should only fail when it doesn't produce the expected result.
    
    Since the WordPress Importer plugin is considered a hard requirement for the test suite at this time, this commit moves the check whether the plugin is installed from individual tests to the test bootstrap.
    
    Includes defining a global constant for the path to the file for reuse in the tests.

    App Passwords: Don't prevent non-unique App Password names.
    
    In [50030] we enforced that Application Passwords have unique names. This was done with the assumption that applications would not connect to a user multiple times. However, in practice we've seen applications run into issues with the unique name constraint. Depending on the app, they may not know if they've been authorized before, or they may intentionally allow connecting multiple times. To prevent friction, App developers need to make their App Name unique, and in doing so often include things like the current date & time, which is already included in the App Passwords list table.
    
    This commit removes this requirement to simplify usage of the Authorize Application flow.

    Build: Prepare for more Script Modules
    
    This is a companion to https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/65460 that requires syncing in WordPress Core. Namely, the block-library changes require registration with their updated script module IDs so that the blocks continue to work correctly.
    
    They key improvement is script modules registration is handled in one central place, and a combined asset file is used to improve the performance by avoiding multiple disk operations for every individual file.

    Build/Test Tools: Prevent Composer lock file from being created.
    
    Composer 1.10.0 introduced a `lock` config option, which, when set to `false` will prevent a `composer.lock` file from being created and will ignore it when one exists.
    
    This is a useful option for packages like WordPress where the `lock` file has no meaning.
    
    It also makes life more straightforward for contributors as they don't have to remember that for this repo they should use `composer update` instead of `composer install`. Both will now work the same.

    HTML API: Add `normalize()` to give us the HTML we always wanted.
    
    HTML often appears in ways that are unexpected. It may be missing implicit tags, may have unquoted, single-quoted, or double-quoted attributes, may contain duplicate attributes, may contain unescaped text content, or any number of other possible invalid constructions. The HTML API understands all fo these inputs, but downline parsers may not, and HTML snippets which are safe on their own may introduce problems when joined with other HTML snippets.
    
    This patch introduces the `serialize()` method on the HTML Processor, which prints a fully-normative HTML output, eliminating invalid markup along the way. It produces a string which contains every missing tag, double-quoted attributes, and no duplicates. A `normalize()` static method on the HTML Processor provides a convenient wrapper for constructing a fragment parser and immediately serializing.
    
    Subclasses relying on the `serialize_token()` method may perform structural HTML modifications with as much security as the upcoming `\Dom\HTMLDocument()` parser will, though these are not
    able to provide the full safety that will eventually appear with `set_inner_html()`.
    
    Further work may explore serializing to XML (which involves a number of other important transformations) and adding constraints to serialization (such as only allowing inline/flow/formatting elements and text).

    HTML API: Add `get_full_comment_text()` method.
    
    Previously, there were a few cases where the modifiable text read from an HTML comment differs slightly from the parsed value of its inner text in a browser. This is due to the specific way that invalid HTML syntax tokens become "bogus comments."
    
    This patch introduces a new method to the Tag Processor to allow differentiating these specific cases, such as when copying or serializing HTML from one source to another. Similar code has already been in use in the html5lib tests, and this patch simplifies the test runner, evidencing the fact that this method was already needed.

    External Libraries: Test registered script versions match package.json.
    
    Expands tests to ensure the version number of packages updated via NPM matches the version number used for registering the script in the script loader.
    
    This adds tests for (by their registered name in WordPress):
    
    * backbone
    * clipboard
    * hoverIntent
    * hoverintent-js
    * imagesloaded
    * jquery-color
    * jquery-core

    * masonry
    * react-jsx-runtime
    * underscore
    * wp-polyfill-dom-rect
    * wp-polyfill-element-closest
    * wp-polyfill-fetch
    * wp-polyfill-formdata
    * wp-polyfill-inert
    * wp-polyfill-node-contains
    * wp-polyfill-object-fit
    * wp-polyfill-url
    
    
    This expands on the earlier tests introduced for:
    
    * lodash
    * moment
    * react
    * react-dom
    * regenerator-runtime
    
    An additional test is added to ensure that the data provider for these tests is maintained as libraries are added via package.json.
    
    `@wordpress/*` scripts are excluded from these tests as wp-scripts generates a version number automatically based on the file's contents.
    
    Additionally, the version of element-closest listed in package.json is updated to use a fixed version rather than a range. This reflects the current practice of WordPress to define the specific version in core. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not affect the version shipped in WordPress.

    External Libraries: Skip instanceof check when null in Text_Diff::_check().
    
    On the first `foreach` loop in Text_Diff::_check()`, `$prevtype` is `null`. As `instanceof` requires the class name term to be an object or string, a fatal error is thrown:
    
    >Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class name must be a valid object or a string on line 279
    
    This change:
    * Adds a simple test for the `Text_Diff::_check()` method, which is how the bug was discovered as the test could never pass with the code as-is.
    
    * Adds a defensive guard to protect against the fatal. It checks if `$prevtype` is not `null` as a pre-condition to for checking the instance. This bugfix also resolves the failing test.

    Code Modernization: handle mysqli_ping() deprecation in wpdb::check_connection().
    
    The `mysqli_ping()` function is deprecated as of PHP 8.4, though, in reality, the function wasn't working according to spec anymore since PHP 8.2 when the `libmysql` driver was dropped in favour of `libmysqlnd`, which was already the default (and recommended) driver since PHP 5.4.
    
    The `mysqli_ping()` method was also not really correctly named as its functionality was to reconnect to the database, not just ping.
    
    The alternative is to "manually" ping the database by sending a `DO 1` query (the cheapest possible SQL query).
    
    Adding a PHP version based toggle was considered, but as mentioned above, the default driver has been `libmysqlnd` since PHP 5.4 and in that case, the function never worked anyway, so in reality `mysqli_ping()` was only really functional for the odd custom PHP compilation where `mysqli` was build against `libmysql` AND `reconnect` was not disabled.
    
    With this in mind, this change replaces the call to `mysqli_ping()` with the `DO 1` query completely. If that query succeeds, it concludes the database connection is still alive. This solution should be the most stable as it will work for both PHP 7.2 <= 8.1, independently of which driver `mysqli` was compiled with, as well as for PHP 8.2+.
    
    Note: It could also be considered to remove the function call to `mysqli_ping()` completely and rely on standard error handling in case the connection would have dropped, as after all, the fact that the connection existed at the moment the "ping" happened, is no guarantee that the connection will still exist when the next query is send.... this approach was not chosen so as WP has custom error handling and does not use the PHP native mysqli exceptions for this, which would make implementing this more awkward.
    
    Includes a test to verify that the connection check works when there is a valid connection (this was previously not covered by tests).

    Prevents a potential type errors when making use of the `gmt_offset` option by casting the value to a float prior to performing calculations with the value.

    Code Modernization: Remove xml_set_object() in MagpieRSS::__construct().
    
    The XML Parser extension still supports a quite dated mechanism for method based callbacks, where the object is first set via `xml_set_object()` and the callbacks are then set by passing only the name of the method to the relevant parameters on any of the `xml_set_*_handler()` functions.
    
    {{{
    xml_set_object( $parser, $my_obj );
    xml_set_character_data_handler( $parser, 'method_name_on_my_obj' );
    }}}
    
    Passing proper callables to the `xml_set_*_handler()` functions has been supported for the longest time and is cross-version compatible. So the above code is 100% equivalent to:
    
    {{{
    xml_set_character_data_handler( $parser, [$my_obj, 'method_name_on_my_obj'] );
    }}}
    
    The mechanism of setting the callbacks with `xml_set_object()` has now been deprecated as of PHP 8.4, in favour of passing proper callables to the `xml_set_*_handler()` functions. This is also means that calling the `xml_set_object()` function is deprecated as well.
    
    This commit fixes this deprecation for the `MagpieRSS::__construct()` method.
    
    The change has not been not covered by tests. This class has been deprecated since WP 3.0.0 and is not covered by tests at all. Adding those now seems superfluous, all the more as the principle of the fix is no different than for the other files, so we can be sure it works anyway.
    
    Note: Though this is "officially" an external library, this package is no longer externally maintained. The code style of the fix in the source file is in line with the existing code style for the file.

    * It appears that this class is not actually used by WP Core itself, so it could be considered to deprecate the class. However, as the class is not currently deprecated, safeguarding the change with a test seemed prudent.
    * The fixture used for the test reuses a fixture from the original package: https://code.google.com/archive/p/phpatomlib/source/default/source
    * The new test class follows the recommended test format (naming convention of the class, `@covers` tag at class level, only testing one method) as per Trac tickets 62004 / 53010.

    WP_Debug_Data: Extract `wp-media` data into separate method.
    
    This is the sixth part in a larger modularization of the data in `WP_Debug_Data`. Previously this was a single massive method drawing in debug data from various groups of related data, where the groups were independent from each other.
    
    This patch separates the sixth of twelve groups, the `wp-media` info, into a separate method focused on that data.
    
    This work precedes changes to make the `WP_Debug_Data` class more extensible for better use by plugin and theme code.

    Code Modernization: Explicitly declare all properties in AtomParser.
    
    Dynamic (non-explicitly declared) properties are deprecated as of PHP 8.2 and are expected to become a fatal error in PHP 9.0.
    
    There are a number of ways to mitigate this:
    * If it's an accidental typo for a declared property: fix the typo.
    * For known properties: declare them on the class.
    * For unknown properties: add the magic `__get()`, `__set()` et al methods to the class or let the class extend `stdClass` which has highly optimized versions of these magic methods build in.
    * For unknown _use of_ dynamic properties, the `#[AllowDynamicProperties]` attribute can be added to the class. The attribute will automatically be inherited by child classes.
    
    In this case, the property added are explicitly referenced in this class, so fall in the "known property" category.

    Tests: Introduce assertion for comparing file paths independent of OS-specifics.
    
    Introduces `WP_UnitTestCase_Base::assertSamePathIgnoringDirectorySeparators()` and an associated helper method `WP_UnitTestCase_Base::normalizeDirectorySeparatorsInPath()` to allow for comparing two file path strings independently of OS-specific differences.
    
    The normalization is done in a separate method to also allow this method to be used for path normalization within test methods themselves, like for normalizing a group of paths in an array.
    
    The pretty specific method name for the helper (`normalizeDirectorySeparatorsInPath()`) is an attempt to prevent naming conflicts with methods which may exist in plugin test suites build on top of the WP Core test suite.

    This commit fixes this deprecation for the `TestXMLParser` helper utility. In this case, the callbacks were already using the recommended format and the call to `xml_set_object()` was completely redundant.
    
    As this is a test utility and was already causing pre-existing tests using the utility to fail, there is no need for dedicated tests to cover this change.

    Code Modernization: Fix implicitly nullable parameter in WP_HTML_Processor.
    
    PHP 8.4 deprecates implicitly nullable parameters, i.e. typed parameters with a `null` default value, which are not explicitly declared as nullable.
    
    This commit the one instance of this in the `WP_HTML_Processor` class.
    
    Fixed by adding the nullability operator to the type, which is supported since PHP 7.1, so we can use it now the minimum supported PHP version is PHP 7.2.
    
    As this deprecation is thrown at compile time, it can be seen at the top of the test output when running on PHP 8.4 (which will be gone once this change has been committed). It is not possible to write a test to cover this.

    Tests: Fix implicitly nullable parameters in Tests_HtmlApi_WpHtmlProcessorComments.
    
    PHP 8.4 deprecates implicitly nullable parameters, i.e. typed parameters with a `null` default value, which are not explicitly declared as nullable.
    
    The `Tests_HtmlApi_WpHtmlProcessorComments` test class contains one problematic parameter in the `test_comment_processing()` method declaration.
    
    While this could be fixed by adding the nullability operator, the type declarations in the test method is removed instead, including other type declarations for this method and the second test method, which were not affected by the deprecation.
    
    The reason for this is quite straight-forward: using type declarations in tests is bad practice and inhibits defense-in-depth type testing.
    
    Using type declarations in tests prevents being able to test the "code under test" with unexpected input types as the values with unexpected (scalar) types will be juggled to the expected type between the data provider and the test method and the _real_ data value would therefore never reach the method under test.
    
    The knock-on effects of this are:
    * That the input handling of the "code under test" can not be safeguarded, whether this input handling is done via in-function type checking or via a type declaration in the "code under test".
    * That if such "unexpected data type" tests are added to the data provider, they will silently pass (due to the type being juggled before reaching the "code under test"), giving a false sense of security, while in actual fact, these data sets would not be testing anything at all and if, for instance, the type declaration in the "code under test" would be removed, these tests would still pass, while by rights they should start failing.
    
    Also note that this problem would only be exacerbated if the file would be put under `strict_types`.

    Build Tools: Allow easier customization of the .env file.
    
    The .env file allows for configuring how the WordPress Local environment should be configured. However, because the file is version controlled, developers must be careful not to commit their modifications.
    
    This commit renames the .env file to be .env.example. During env start, the .env.example file is copied to .env if it does not exist. This allows for contributors to continue using the project without thinking about .env and to make changes when needed. This brings WordPress Core into the dotenv project guidelines.

    REST API: Only check password value in query parameters while checking post permissions.
    
    The `password` property which gets sent as part of a request POST body while setting a post's password should not be checked when calculating post visibility permissions.
    
    That value in the request body is intended to update the post, not to authenticate, and may be malformed or an invalid non-string type which would cause a fatal when checking against the hashed post password value.
    
    Query parameter `?password=` values are the correct interface to check, and are also guaranteed to be strings.

    REST API: Support exact search in the REST API posts endpoint.
    
    This changeset adds support for a new `search_semantics` enum query parameter that can be passed alongside the `search` string parameter. At this point, it only supports "exact" as possible value, but an enum is used for forward compatibility with potential enhancements like "sentence" search support. If `search_semantics=exact` is passed, it will look for an exact match rather than do a full text search, which for some use-cases is more appropriate and more performant.

    REST API: Automatically populate targetHints for the Allow header.
    
    The REST API uses the "Allow" header to communicate what methods a user is authorized to perform on a resource. This works great when operating on a single item route, but can break down when needing to determine authorization over a collection of items.
    
    This commit uses the "targetHints" property of JSON Hyper Schema to provide access to the "allow" header for "self" links. This alleviates needing to make a separate network request for each item in a collection.

    An infinite loop was discovered in specific situations within foreign content inside the HTML Processor when a given node inside foreign content must be handled in the rules for the current insertion mode.
    
    This patch resolves the loop by handling those nodes directly instead of reprocessing the node, which previously was redirecting control flow back to where the loop started.

    Increases the frequency of heartbeat API requests from once every 15 seconds to once every 10 seconds.

    HTML API: Make WP_HTML_Processor::get_tag() namespace aware.
    
    The HTML specification indicates that an HTML tag with the name "IMAGE"
    should be renamed as "IMG" and handled as if it were an "IMG", but this
    only applies to elements in the HTML namespace.
    
    In this patch the HTML Processor is updated to ensure that it doesn't
    remap the tag name when processing foreign content, such as SVG and
    MathML markup.

    Media: Add auto sizes for lazy-loaded images.
    
    This implements the HTML spec for applying auto sizes to lazy-loaded images by prepending `auto` to the `sizes` attribute generated by WordPress if the image has a `loading` attribute set to `lazy`. For browser that support this HTML spec, the image's size value will be set to the concrete object size of the image. For browsers that don't support the spec, the word "auto" will be ignored when parsing the sizes value.

    HTML API: Add sentinels for unreachable code.
    
    There are places in the HTML API code where some tools get confused and flag invalid types for the return of a function because they are unable to detect that the end of the function is unreachable.
    
    Since PHP doesn't provide a way to encode total matching in the source code, this patch adds a few extra lines in those unreachable locations to satisfy any tooling which isn't able to fully analyze the code.
    
    Additionally this serves as extra guarding in case someone changes these functions in a way which would break them and the existing test suite doesn't catch those breakages.

    Debug Data: Encode section ordering in debug info.
    
    During a refactor to modularize the debug data class, it came up that the ordering of the sections inside of the returned debug info is relevant to existing UIs, as they iterate the array, which happens in insertion order.
    
    This patch presets each section at the start to ensure that the ordering remains consistent even as code within the method is rearranged. As the mini-project progresses, this assignment will be the final place all the sections are referenced.

    HTML API: Only examine HTML nodes in `pop_until()` instack of open elements.
    
    The `pop_until( $tag_name )` method in the stack of open elements should only be examining HTML elements, but it has only been checking the tag name. This has led to closing the wrong tags when run from inside foreign content. A very specific situation where this may arise is when a `TEMPLATE` closer is found inside foreign content, inside another template.
    
    {{{
    HTML:template   SVG:template                 HTML:/template
    <template><svg><template><foreignObject><div></template><div>
    â°ââ< this outer TEMPLATE is closed by this one >ââââ¯
    }}}
    
    This patch constains the method to checking for elements matching the tag name which are in the HTML namespace so that the proper detection occurs.

    HTML API: Respect document compat mode when handling CSS class names.
    
    The HTML API has been behaving as if CSS class name selectors matched class names in an ASCII case-insensitive manner. This is only true if the document in question is set to quirks mode. Unfortunately most documents processed will be set to no-quirks mode, meaning that some CSS behaviors have been matching incorrectly when provided with case variants of class names.
    
    In this patch, the CSS methods have been audited and updated to adhere to the rules governing ASCII case sensitivity when matching classes. This includes `add_class()`, `remove_class()`, `has_class()`, and `class_list()`. Now, it is assumed that a document is in no-quirks mode unless a full HTML parser infers quirks mode, and these methods will treat class names in a byte-for-byte manner. Otherwise, when a document is in quirks mode, the methods will compare the provided class names against existing class names for the tag in an ASCII case insensitive way, while `class_list()` will return a lower-cased version of the existing class names.
    
    The lower-casing in `class_list()` is performed for consistency, since it's possible that multiple case variants of the same comparable class name exists on a tag in the input HTML.

    Docs: Add changing existing items recommendations to 'admin_bar_menu' action.
    
    Improves the `'admin_bar_menu'` docblock by adding recommendations for customizing / changing existing items.
    
    It also improves the `wp_admin_bar_render()` function's docblock by removing the "most optimal point" sentence.
    
    The [58748] changeset moved the user menu to a higher priority level (of `9991`) to achieve:
    
    >so nodes added with higher priorities will still be shown visually before the user and recovery menu items, as they were prior to [58215].
    
    When hooking into `'admin_bar_menu'` with a priority level less than 9991 and attempting to get the `'my-account'` node, `null` is returned. While the preferred approach is to hook into `'wp_before_admin_bar_render'`, the documentation of the `'admin_bar_menu'` action was previously misleading.

    Options, Meta APIs: Explicitly pass `$autoload` parameter to when potentially adding new options.
    
    It is recommended that for every option it is explicitly set whether to autoload it or not. This changeset updates relevant `update_option()` and `add_option()` calls.
    
    Note that the `$autoload` parameter is only needed for `update_option()` if the option is potentially not present yet, i.e. the call will pass through to `add_option()`. Since WordPress core adds the majority of its options to the database during installation, only `update_option()` calls for dynamically added options need to be modified, which is what this changeset does.
    
    As part of revisiting the autoload values for dynamically added WordPress core options, this changeset modifies some options to no longer be autoloaded, since they are only accessed in a few specific places that are not relevant for a regular request. These options are:
    * `recently_activated`
    * `_wp_suggested_policy_text_has_changed`
    * `{upgradeLock}.lock`
    * `dashboard_widget_options`
    * `ftp_credentials`
    * `adminhash`
    * `nav_menu_options`
    * `wp_force_deactivated_plugins`
    * `delete_blog_hash`
    * `allowedthemes`
    * `{sessionId}_paused_extensions`
    * `recovery_keys`
    * `https_detection_errors`
    * `fresh_site`
    
    An upgrade routine is present as well that sets those options to no longer autoload for existing sites.

    Media: Consistently pass 'src' attribute to `wp_get_loading_optimization_attributes()`.
    
    A common use-case for the 'wp_get_loading_optimization_attributes' filter is to modify attributes based on the 'src' attribute. However, the `wp_img_tag_add_loading_optimization_attrs()` was not passing that attribute to the function as expected, which would make such usage of the filter unreliable. This changeset ensures the 'src' attribute is also passed in this scenario. All other calls to `wp_get_loading_optimization_attributes()` already included the attribute.

This patch calls the `get_unsupported_exception()` method in these skipped cases to improve the messages reported to PHPUnit so they're more informative: e.g. "Unsupported markup: Foster parenting is not supported."

    HTML API: Allow subdividing text nodes by meaningful prefixes.
    
    HTML parsing rules at times differentiate character tokens that are all null bytes, all whitespace, or other content. This patch introduces a new function which may be used to classify text node sub-regions and lead to more efficient application of these parsing rules.
    
    Further, when classified in this way, application code may skip some rules and decoding entirely, improving performance. For example, this can be used to ease the implementation of skipping inter-element whitespace, which is usually not rendered.

    HTML API: Fix logic bug in HTML Processor when opening A element.
    
    A mistake in the original code handling opening A elements in the HTML Processor led to mistakes in parsing where the Processor would bail in situations when it could have proceeded. While this was errant behavior, it didn't violate the public contract since it would bail in these situations.
    
    This patch fixes the mistake, which was to only break out of the innermost loop instead of breaking from the containing loop, which resolves the issue.

    External Libraries: Update jQuery Color to version `3.0.0`.
    
    This update most notably drops support for jQuery `< 1.12` and `< 2.2`. WordPress has not shipped with a version that matches these ranges since version 4.4 (see [36285]/#35380).
    
    The update also changes the libraryâs browser support policy to only support the latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. This closely matches Coreâs current policy to support the last 2 versions of these browsers. The libraryâs README notes that other versions nay âalso work correctly with this plugin but support is not guaranteedâ, which is reasonably similar.

    Options, Meta APIs: Soft-deprecate use of 'yes' and 'no' as `$autoload` parameter.
    
    WordPress 6.6 option autoload enhancements included discouraging the use of 'yes' and 'no' to indicate whether to autoload an option when calling `add_option()` or `update_option()`. Instead, a boolean should be used.
    
    This changeset brings the newer autoload related functions `wp_set_option_autoload_values()`, `wp_set_options_autoload()`, and `wp_set_option_autoload()` in line with those changes. Additionally, it soft-deprecates the values more formally, as they should no longer be used. No PHP warnings will be emitted though as this is not a hard deprecation. This change is purely about documentation.

    HTML API: Add support for missing FRAMESET and "after" insertion modes.
    
    As part of work to add more spec support to the HTML API, this patch adds support for the FRAMESET-related insertion modes, as well as the set of missing after insertion modes. These modes run at the end of parsing a document, closing it and taking care of any lingering tags.

    HTML API: Parse DOCTYPE tokens and set HTML parser mode accordingly.
    
    This patch adds until-now missing code to parse the structure of HTML DOCTYPE declarations. The DOCTYPE is mostly unused but can dictate the document compatability mode, which governs whether CSS class names match in a ASCII-case-insensitive way or not, and whether TABLE elements close an open P element.
    
    The DOCTYPE information is made available through a new method on the Tag Processor, `get_doctype_info()`.

    Site Health: Check if the directories are allowed when testing for a VCS checkout.
    
    As part of determining whether to perform automatic updates, WordPress checks if it is running within a version-controlled environment, recursively looking up the filesystem to the top of the drive, looking for a Subversion, Git, Mercurial, or Bazaar directory, erring on the side of detecting a VCS checkout somewhere.
    
    This commit reuses `WP_Automatic_Updater::is_allowed_dir()` in the Site Health test to avoid a PHP warning if the `open_basedir` directive is in use and any of the directories checked in the process are not allowed:
    {{{
    is_dir(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/.git) is not within the allowed path(s)

    Tests: Remove 'errors' assertion when not WP_Error in Tests_Term_WpInsertTerm.
    
    Removes the assertion for 'errors' being empty when the instance is `WP_Term` and not `WP_Error`. This property exists on `WP_Error`.
    
    This assertion always passed because it was checking a dynamic property on `WP_Term` that does not exist and is not added within Core. Thus, this assertion is not needed and fails with dynamic property deprecations.

    Tests: Remove WP_Term::$filter property unset() within term tests.
    
    Removes the `unset()` of the `WP_Term::$filter` property within the term tests.
    
    Why?
    
    Prior to the introduction of WP_Term, the term was added to the cache when its filter property was empty. To test the cache, the tests unset this property to trigger `wp_cache_add()` in `get_term()`. [34997] changed that behavior to trigger `wp_cache_add()` when the term was not found after `wp_cache_get()` (i.e. happened in `WP_Term::get_instance()`).
    
    Unsetting the filter property is and was not needed. Prior to `WP_Term`, the condition was an empty value. With `WP_Term`, the filter property is no longer part of the conditional logic for caching.

    Taxonomy: Correct the check for error messages in `wp-admin/edit-tag-form.php`.
    
    Instead of checking for a specific message, e.g. âItem not updatedâ, the `$_REQUEST['error']` variable is now checked. This allows for custom messages added via the `term_updated_messages` filter to be considered an error when appropriate, and displayed with the correct CSS class.
    
    This also brings consistency with a similar check in `wp-admin/edit-tags.php`.

    The `wp-content/upgrade` directory does not exist initially after installation, so the Site Health check could not determine the available disk space until the directory was subsequently created during an update.
    
    By testing `WP_CONTENT_DIR` instead, the check can complete successfully.

    * Fix typo for `wp_template_part` post type preload path for the Site Editor.
    * Do not preload the `wp_block` post type for post editors. The endpoint doesn't support unbound queries, and the data is no longer needed during editor initialization.

    Meta: Add .mailmap to ascribe git commits to proper author.
    
    From time to time a new commit will appear from an existing commit which has a different name or email address (or both) than an existing name or email address. This occurs because of changing names and changing emails and because of mistakes. Additionally, the `svg`-to-`git` process double-encodes names from `profiles.wordpress.org` causing corruption in names with non-US-ASCII characters.
    
    This patch introduces a `.mailmap` file to alias committers so that:
    
     - All contributions for a given person are shown for that person.
     - Committers will be able to control or fix the display of their own name.
    
    The `.mailmap` file is a standard `git` configuration.

    Fixes a regression introduced in [58241] where selectors with pseudo elements are wrapped within `:where()` causing malformed CSS and the CSS rule(s) not being applied.
    
    When processing custom CSS for blocks, this changeset:
    
    * Strips the pseudo-elements from the original nested selector, performs the required wrapping in `:root :where`, then re-appends the pseudo-element selector with its leading combinators if present.
    * Removes empty CSS rules.

    HTML API: Only stop on full matches for requested tag name.
    
    An optimization pass on the HTML API left a bug in the `matches()`
    method, whereby it would falsely detect a tag name match if the
    found tag were a lexical subset of the requested tag. This occurred
    because of the use of `substr_compare()` without checking that the
    outer lengths matched.
    
    This patch resolves the bug by adding the length check.

    Editor: Fix bumped specificity for layout styles in non-iframed editor.
    
    Fixes a regression introduced in [58241] which inadvertently bumped the specificity in a non-iframed editor for `.editor-styles-wrapper .is-layout-flow > *` from (0,1,0) to (0,2,0). This fix restores theme.json spacing rules taking precedence over the implicit spacing rules in a non-iframed editor.
    
    **The What**
    
    When the block editor is not iframed (which can happen when Custom Fields are active, or blocks that use and older `apiVersion` are present), style rules are processed using post css to append the `.editor-styles-wrapper` class name. This has the effect of scoping the the style rules to ensure they don't affect the editor chrome or admin.
    
    With [58241], one of the rules was changed to `.is-layout-flow > *`. In a iframed editor, the specificity of this rule is okay (0,1,0), but in a non-iframed editor it becomes `.editor-styles-wrapper .is-layout-flow > *`, a specificity of (0,2,0). Comparing this to before [58241], the same rule was `.editor-styles-wrapper :where(body .is-layout-flow) > *` (specificity 0,1,0). This is a regression in specificity that has caused some issues. Notably themes can no longer properly override the spacing for blocks using theme.json and have the results correctly shown in the non-iframed editor.
    
    **The How**
    
    This changeset modifies the selector to `:root :where(.is-layout-flow) > *` (still specificity 0,1,0). `transformStyles` handles 'root' selectors a little differently, it'll instead replace the `:root` part so it becomes `.editor-styles-wrapper where(.is-layout-flow) > *` (keeping the specificity at 0,1,0).
    
    The other layout selector that this affects is the `:first-child` `:last-child` selectors that are responsible for resetting margin at the start and end of a block list. They traditionally have a 0,2,0 specificity so that they can override both the above rule and any rules in the theme.json. Those selectors are also maintained at 0,2,0 with this change, they become something like `:root :where(.is-layout-flow) > :first-child`.

    Build/Test Tools: Avoid using `wp_delete_user()` in PHPUnit tests unless explicitly acknowledging or ignoring Multisite.
    
    `wp_delete_user()` does not actually delete the entire user when using WordPress Multisite. Therefore tests should typically use the test helper method to fully delete the user, unless explicitly ignoring Multisite or testing the `wp_delete_user()` function while taking Multisite behavior into account.
    
    Fixes #61851.

    Comments: Add optional `$context` parameter to `get_edit_comment_link()` to get the URL without HTML entities.
    
    This brings the function in line with the similar `get_edit_post_link()` parameter. The 'get_edit_comment_link' filter now additionally receives the `$comment_id` and `$context` as parameters.
    
    Additionally, as a minor enhancement, the capability check is now more defensive, as it will no longer cause an error if the given comment ID is invalid.
    
    As part of the changeset, comprehensive test coverage for the `get_edit_comment_link()` including the new behavior is added.

    HTML API: Test and fix SVG script handling.
    
    When support was added for foreign content, an ambiguity in the HTML specification led to code that followed the wrong path when encountering a self-closing SCRIPT element in the SVG namespace. Further, a fallthrough was discovered during manual testing.
    
    This patch adds a new test to assert the proper behaviors and fixes these issues. In the case of the SCRIPT element, the outcome was the same with the wrong code path, making the defect benign. In the case of the fallthrough, the wrong behavior would occur.
    
    The updates in this patch also resolves a todo relating to the spec ambiguity.

    HTML API: `expect_closer()` should report false for self-closing foreign elements.
    
    Previously, `WP_HTML_Processor::expects_closer()` would report `true` for self-closing foreign elements when called without supplying a node in question, but it should have been reporting `true` just as it does for HTML elements.
    
    This patch adds a test case demonstrating the issue and a bugfix.
    
    The `html5lib` test runner was relying on the incorrect behavior, accidentally working. This is also corrected and the `html5lib` test now relies on the correct behavior of `expects_closer()`.

    HTML API: Add support for SVG and MathML (Foreign content) (remove file)
    
    As part of work to add more spec support to the HTML API, this patch adds support for SVG and MathML elements, or more generally, "foreign content."
    
    The rules in foreign content are a mix of XML and HTML parsing rules and introduce additional complexity into the processor, but is important in order to avoid getting lost when inside these elements.

    HTML API: Ensure that `get_modifiable_text()` reads enqueued updates.
    
    When `set_modifiable_text()` was added to the Tag Processor, it was considered that the same information could be queried after setting its value and before proceeding to the next token, but unfortunately overlooked that if the starting modifiable text length was zero, then the read in `get_modifiable_text()` would ignore enqueued updates.
    
    In this patch, `get_modifiable_text()` will read any enqueued values before reading from the input HTML document to ensure consistency.

    HTML API: Use full parser in html5lib tests.
    
    Previously the `html5lib` tests have only run in the fragment parser mode,
    assuming IN BODY context. This limited the number of tests which could run
    and was a result of the HTML Processor only supporting the IN BODY fragment
    parser. In [58836], however, a full parser was added to the HTML Processor.
    
    In this patch the full parser is utilized in order to run more of the
    previously-skipped tests, asserting more behaviors in the HTML parsing.

    WP_Debug_Data: Extract `wp-constants` data into separate method.
    
    This is the part two in a larger modularization of the data in `WP_Debug_Data`.

    Media: Automatically convert HEIC images to JPEG
    
    Automatically create a JPEG version of uploaded HEIC images if the server has
    a version of Imagick that supports HEIC. Conversion is done silently through
    the existing `WP_Image_Editor` infrastructure that creates multiple sizes of
    uploaded images.
    
    This allows users to view HEIC images in WP Admin and use them in their posts
    and pages regardless of whether their browser supports HEIC. Browser support
    for HEIC is relatively low (only Safari) while the occurrence of HEIC images is
    relatively common. The original HEIC image can be downloaded via a link on

    HTML API: Fix an infinite loop in certain unclosed SCRIPT tags.
    
    When the Tag Processor (or HTML Processor) attempts to parse certain
    incomplete script tags, the parser enters an infinite loop and will
    hang indefinitely. The conditions to reach this situation are:
    
    - Input HTML ends with an open script tag.
    - The final character of input is `-` or `<`.
    
    The infinite loop was caused by the parser-advancing increment not being
    called when two `||` OR conditions short-circuited. If the first
    condition was true, the `$at++` code was never reached.
    
    This path resolves the issue.

    HTML API: Indicate when WordPress rejects attribute updates.
    
    When setting an an attribute value in the HTML API, WordPress may reject
    an update based on rules in `kses`. In these cases, the return value from
    an escaping function will be an empty string, and the HTML API should
    reject the update. Unfortunately, it currently reports that it updates the
    attribute but sets an empty string value, which is misleading.
    
    In this patch, the HTML API will refuse the attribute update and return
    false to indicate as much when WordPress rejects the updates.

    HTML API: Introduce full parsing mode in HTML Processor.
    
    The HTML Processor has only supported a specific kind of parsing mode
    called _the fragment parsing mode_, where it behaves in the same way
    that `node.innerHTML = html` does in the DOM. This mode assumes a

    REST API, Meta: Store updates in database when they are equal to the defaults.
    
    This patch fixes an oversight from when default metadata values were introduced
    in #43941 in WordPress 5.5: metadata updates should persist in the database
    even if they match the registered default value (because the default values
    can change over time).
    
    Previously, the REST API code was comparing updated values against the value
    returned by the default-aware `get_metadata()` method. This meant that if no
    value existed in the database, and the default value was supplied to the update,
    WordPress would think that the updated value was already persisted and skip
    the database call.
    
    Now, the `get_metadata_raw()` method is called for comparing whether or not
    a database update is required, fixing the bug.
    
    In this patch both issues are resolved.

    Users: Always use HTTPS URLs for Gravatar links.
    
    Modifies gravatar image URLs to always use the HTTPS version from secure.gravatar.com.
    
    Gravatar now redirects HTTP image requests to their HTTPS equivalent, resulting in redirects for sites running over an HTTP connection (`is_ssl() === false`). Since the introduction of HTTP/2 the use of sub-domains for different hashes ([1-3].gravatar.com) now represents a performance hinderance rather than improvement.
    
    The scheme passed to `get_avatar_data()` is now ignored for the generation of Gravatar URLs but the setting retained to avoid introducing bugs for sites using either local avatars or third party providers.

    General: Introduce `wp_get_wp_version()` to get unmodified version.
    
    Introduces `wp_get_wp_version()` to get an unmodified value of `$wp_version` from `wp-includes/version.php`. Some plugins modify the global in an attempt to improve security through obscurity. This practice can cause errors in WordPress so the ability to get an unmodified version is needed.
    
    Replaces instances within the code base in which `version.php` was required in order to get an unmodified value. `script-loader.php` is intentionally excluded from the replacements as the function is not always available to the file.

    Comments: Only type cast a scalar `$comment_id` in `get_comment_author_link()`.
    
    This aims to resolve a fatal error when the incoming `$comment_id` is an instance of `WP_Comment` (or any object) without a `comment_ID` property defined, or if it's empty:

    Object of class WP_Comment could not be converted to string
    }}}
    
    This commit mirrors the changes previously made for a similar code fragment in `get_comment_author()`.
    
    Includes:
    * Unit tests to demonstrate the fatal error and validate the fix.
    * Changing the default value for a non-existent comment ID in `get_comment_author()` from an empty string to zero as a numeric string, for consistency with `get_comment_ID()`.

    block.json: Allow passing PHP filename as `variations` field.
    
    Previously, the `variations` field in a block.json file could be used to provide a static list of the block's variations (i.e., an array). Alternatively, the block's `variation_callback` could be set during server-side block registration to point to a PHP function to generate those variations.
    
    This changeset makes it so that the block.json `variations` field can be alternatively set to a string, which will be interpreted as the filename of a PHP file that generates the variations.
    
    It is loosely modeled after [54132], which introduced the `render` field for `block.json`, as a way to point to a PHP file instead of providing a `render_callback`.

    The `inject_ignored_hooked_blocks_metadata_attributes` filter that is attached to both the `rest_pre_insert_wp_template` and `rest_pre_insert_wp_template_part` hooks receives a `stdClass` object from the Templates REST API controller that contains all fields that the client would like to modify when making a `POST` request (plus the `id` to identify the relevant template or template part, respectively).
    
    There are cases when the `post_content` field is not set, e.g. when the client would like to rename an existing template (in which case it would only set the `title` field).
    
    Prior to this changeset, the filter would erroneously apply the Block Hooks algorithm to the non-existent `post_content` field regardless, which would result in it being set to the empty string `''`. As a consequence, renaming a template would have the unwanted side effect of wiping its contents.
    
    This changeset fixes the issue by returning early from the filter if the `post_content` field is not set.

    HTML API: Fix unsupported insertion mode messages.
    
    Insertion modes in an HTML parser may include instructions like "process
    the token in the IN HEAD insertion mode." The rules do not change the
    insertion mode of the parser, but the errors are triggered outside of the
    rules for the current insertion mode. These will be misleading when
    bailing on these instructions, because it will point someone to the wrong
    place in the code to find the source of the error.
    
    In this patch all of the bail-points due to lacking insertion mode support
    are hard-coded to better orient someone to the section of the code lacking
    support for handling the input HTML.

    HTML API: Add missing tags in IN BODY insertion mode to HTML Processor.
    
    As part of work to add more spec support to the HTML API, this patch adds
    support for the remaining missing tags in the IN BODY insertion mode. Not
    all of the added tags are supported, because in some cases they reset the
    insertion mode and are reprocessed where they will be rejected.
    
    This patch also improves the support of `get_modifiable_text()`, removing
    a leading newline inside a LISTING, PRE, or TEXTAREA element.

    the problem we faced is that there's a warning that is triggered on the console because we're not using a separate impact for `createRoot`.
    
    This warning has been removed in React 19 along with the removal of the UMD builds, so we should be able to revert this commit when we upgrade to React 19 but for now, we need to restore the usage of the umd builds.

    HTML API: Add PHP type annotations.
    
    This patch adds type annotations to internal and private methods of the HTML
    API and the supporting WP_Token_Map. Annotations have not been added to the

    Comments: Fix fatal error when get_comment_author() receives an object with no comment_id.
    
    [58335] introduced `(string)` type casting of the passed in `$comment_id` value. If `$comment_id` is a scalar, it works as expected. But if it's an `object`, the following fatal error is thrown:
    
    {{{
    Object of class WP_Comment could not be converted to string
    }}}
    
    This fatal error happens when the incoming `$comment_id` is an instance of `WP_Comment` (or any object) without a `comment_ID` (empty).
    
    This changeset adds tests to demonstrate the fatal error and validate the fix.
    
    It fixes the fatal error by restructuring the ternary checks into an `if/elseif/else` structure for the 3 paths:
    
    - When `$comment->comment_ID` is not empty, then it uses the property.
    - When `$comment_id` is scalar, then it type casts it to a `string`.
    - Else, the default is an empty `string`.

    Build/Test Tools: Remove regular 6.2 & 6.3 branch performance testing.
    
    Prior to WordPress 6.4, performance testing was performed using Puppeteer instead of Playwright (converted in [56926]). Because of the flaky nature of the workflow using Puppeteer, it was not converted to the reusable pattern implemented through #61213. It was instead removed from 6.2 and 6.3 in [58301] and [58330], respectively.
    
    This removes the workflow for these branches from the strategy matrix when testing old branches to avoid errors and adds an expanded note about why those branches are missing.

    Upgrade/Install: Update sodium_compat to v1.21.1.
    
    The latest version of sodium_compat includes support for AEGIS and preliminary support for PHP 8.4.
    
    Additionally, the PHP 8.2+ `SensitiveParameter` attribute is now applied where appropriate to functions in the public API. This attribute is used to mark parameters that are sensitive and should be redacted from stack traces.

    Block Themes: Fix invalid css for nested fullwidth layouts with zero padding applied
    
    In the Layout block support, handle 0 values for padding as 0px in calc()
    rules. This resolves a bug for nested fullwidth layouts when zero padding is
    applied. Due to how calc() works, without supplying the unit, the rule will not
    work, resulting in a horizontal scrollbar.

    Toolbar: Move user and recovery menus to a higher priority.
    
    Following [58215], admin bar items in the `top-secondary` group have a changed visual order. Increase the priority of the user and recovery menu items so nodes added with higher priorities will still be shown visually before the user and recovery menu items, as they were prior to 58215.
    
    The items will appear in the reverse of the previous order, but the new order now matches their priority order, rather than being the opposite.

    Fix phpdoc nullable types in some files.
    
    It was found that in several places in the HTML API and its supporting files,
    the wrong form of type annotation was used for optional parameters.
    
    Instead of using `?type`, this patch uses `type|type-of-default-value` instead,
    noting where important if the parameter is optional, and if so, what its default
    value is.

    HTML API: Remove leading whitespace after removing class names.
    
    In part of a larger review of CSS semantics and behaviors, this patch
    takes the opportunity to remove leading whitespace in an updated class
    attribute after the first class in the attribute has been removed.
    
    Previously, if the first class name had been removed, the whitespace
    that formerly followed it would remain in the class attribute. This
    stood in contrast to removing other class names, which removed their
    associated whitespace.
    
    There should be no semantic or functional changes in this patch, only
    a slightly-large diff for modified HTML documents that looks prettier
    when removing the first class name in a class attribute.

    Tests: Use data provider in Tests_Interactivity_API_wpInteractivityAPIFunctions.
    
    Refactors the following tests to use a data provider with named test cases:
    * `test_wp_interactivity_data_wp_context_with_different_arrays()`
    * `test_wp_interactivity_data_wp_context_with_different_arrays_and_a_namespace()`
    * `test_wp_interactivity_data_wp_context_with_json_flags()`
    
    This is better as:
    1. One failing test will not block the other tests from running.
    2. Each test is now referenced by name in any error message, making it more straight forward to see which test failed.
    3. The test no longer contains multiple assertions.

    Tests: Don't declare nested named function in Tests_Interactivity_API_wpInteractivityAPIFunctions.
    
    Once the `test_process_directives_when_block_is_filtered()` method has run, the named `test_render_block_data()` function declared nested within becomes part of the global namespace, which could cause problems for other tests.
    
    Quite apart from the fact that the name starting with `test_`  is confusing (as methods prefixed with `test_` are supposed to be test methods to be run by PHPUnit).
    
    Using a closure for this callback fixes the issue. Declared as `static` for a micro-optimization.

    Filesystem API: Add a return value for `wp_delete_file()`.
    
    This addresses a discrepancy where using `unlink()` allows for checking if it was successful via the return value, but `wp_delete_file()` did not have a return value, making it impossible to verify the result without doing overhead checks if the file still exists.
    
    This also brings more consistency with the other `wp_delete_*()` functions, specifically:
    
    * `wp_delete_file_from_directory()`
    * `wp_delete_post()`
    * `wp_delete_post_revision()`
    * `wp_delete_attachment()`

    HTML API: Add context to Unsupported_Exception class for improved debugging.
    
    The HTML Processor internally throws an exception when it reaches HTML
    that it knows it cannot process, but this exception is not made
    available to calling code. It can be useful to extract more knowledge
    about why it gave up, especially for debugging purposes.
    
    In this patch, more context is added to the WP_HTML_Unsupported_Exception
    and the last exception is made available to calling code through a new
    method, `get_unsupported_exception()`.

    HTML API: Simplify breadcrumb accounting.
    
    Since the HTML Processor started visiting all nodes in a document, both
    real and virtual, the breadcrumb accounting became a bit complicated
    and it's not entirely clear that it is fully reliable.
    
    In this patch the breadcrumbs are rebuilt separately from the stack of
    open elements in order to eliminate the problem of the stateful stack
    interactions and the post-hoc event queue.
    
    Breadcrumbs are greatly simplified as a result, and more verifiably
    correct, in this construction.

    HTML API: Join successive text nodes in html5lib test representation.
    
    Many tests from the html5lib test suite fail because of differences in
    text handling between a DOM API and the HTML API, even though the
    semantics of the parse are equivalent. For example, it's possible in
    the HTML API to read multiple successive text nodes when the tokens
    between them are ignored.
    
    The test suite didn't account for this and so was failing tests. This
    patch improves the construction of the representation to compare
    against the test suite so that those tests don't fail inaccurately.

    Adds a fail-safe to return an empty string should the `switch` ever fall through without returning.
    
    Currently, `WP_REST_Templates_Controller::get_wp_templates_author_text_field()` is tightly coupled to `WP_REST_Templates_Controller::get_wp_templates_original_source_field()`. However, if the `$original_source` values change in either method, but not both, it is possible a `void` or `null` will be returned, rather than a `string`.

    HTML API: Correct node name in `generate_implied_end_tags()`.
    
    The `generate_implied_end_tags()` algorithm has been comparing the
    current node to a list of node names, which means that it won't ever
    pop any elements from the stack of open elements.
    
    This patch corrects the mistake by comparing node name against the
    list, thus fixing the algorithm. This was noted in development work
    for the 6.7 release.

    This commit reverts the code to the code from before the bug fix related to PHP 5.2.6â5.2.17.
    
    As support for PHP 5.2 has been dropped, the workaround for the PHP 5.2 bug is no longer needed.

    Code Modernization: Remove obsolete comments about older PHP versions.
    
    This commit:
    * Removes various comments referencing PHP versions which are no longer supported.
    * Removes various comments containing âhintsâ of things to do after a particular PHP version drop. These hints are incorrect/not actionable for various reasons, so have no value:
     * Even though a function could be turned into a closure, removing the function would be a backward compatibility break which is not acceptable, so this suggestion is not actionable.
     * Short ternaries are forbidden by the coding standard exactly to prevent the faulty code suggested in the comment from getting into the codebase.

    HTML API: Respect `tag_name` query arg in `HTML_Processor::next_tag()`
    
    Previously the HTML Processor was ignoring the `tag_name` argument in
    the `next_tag()` query if it existed. This was wrong adn would lead to
    calling code finding the very next tag, regardless of tag name, instead
    of the requested taag.
    
    This patch adds the tag name detection code into `next_tag()` to fix
    the bug and ensure that `next_tag()` always returns only when finding
    a tag of the given name.

    Users: Avoid ambiguous password reset URLs for usernames ending in a period.
    
    When WordPress sends out a password-reset or new-user email, it generates
    a link for someone to follow in order to take them to the reset page. If
    the user login name ends in a period, however, that generated URL will
    end in a period and many email clients will confuse it with a
    sentence-ending period instead of being part of the query arguments.
    
    In this patch, the generated URL's query argument are rearranged so that
    the link will never end in a period. Alternative ideas were explored to
    create a new function to escape URL-ending periods, but this patch resolves
    the reported problem without raising any further architectural questions.

    HTML API: Implement the _reset insertion mode appropriately_ algorithm.
    
    In order to add support for the SELECT and TABLE tags in the HTML Processor, it
    needs to implement the HTML algorithm named "reset the insertion mode
    appropriately".
    
    This patch implements that algorithm to unblock the additional tag support. The
    algorithm resets the parsing mode after specific state changes in complicated
    situations where alternative rules are in effect (such as rules governing how
    the parser handles tags found within a TABLE element).

    Build/Test Tools: Fix workflow names in test old branches workflow.
    
    After the changes in [58165] and [58645] and all associated backports, the workflow that dispatches regular testing in older branches needed to be updated.
    - The `test-npm.yml` workflow no longer exists.
    - The `test-build-processes.yml` has taken the place of `test-npm.yml` in all branches.
    
    Also, the workflow will now run whenever an old version of the reusable PHPUnit workflow is updated (v1 or v2). This is to ensure the changes donât cause any compatibility problems in older branches.

    Plugins: Remove extra paragraph from plugin row dependency notice.
    
    In `WP_Plugins_List_Table::add_dependencies_to_dependent_plugin_row()`, a `sprintf()` call previously wrapped the `%2$s` placeholder in paragraph tags.
    
    [57769] changed the placeholder's value to use `wp_get_admin_notice()`, which returns a paragraph-wrapped notice by default. As a result, the previous paragraph tags produced an extra, empty paragraph.
    
    This removes the paragraph tags around the `%2$s` placeholder.

    Block Hooks: Allow child insertion into Template Part block.
    
    The Block Hooks mechanism was previously extended to allow insertion of a block as a Navigation block's first or last child. This was implemented by storing the `ignoredHookedBlocks` array in the corresponding `wp_navigation` post's post meta (instead of a metadata attribute on the anchor block).
    
    This changeset extends that mechanism to Template Part blocks, by storing said metadata in the corresponding `wp_template_part` post's post meta, thus allowing extenders to use Block Hooks to insert a block as a Template Part block's first or last child, respectively.

    HTML API: Optimize low-level parsing details in Tag Processor.
    
    Introduces a number of micro-level optimizations in the Tag Processor to
    improve token-scanning performance. Should contain no functional changes.
    
    Based on benchmarking against a list of the 100 most-visited websites,
    these changes result in an average improvement in performance of the Tag
    Processor for scanning tags from between 3.5% and 7.5%.

    REST API: Correct image cropping tools in the block editor.
    
    As of [58457], the width and height cropping values are cast to an integer before the comparison to see if the target width and height differ from the original width and height.
    
    Since they are now integers, it exposes a bug where the `&&` of the `if` conditional meant that if you were only cropping in one dimension, the check wouldn't pass, and cropping would not occur.
    
    In the block editor, the cropping tools are aspect ratio based, so one of the dimensions will always match that of the source image. Therefore, now that the values are cast as integers, the condition that allows a cropping to occur needs to be updated. If either width or height is different from the source image, then a crop should be allowed.

    Build/Test Tools: Introduce two additional reusable PHPUnit workflows.
    
    The changes associated with #61213 aim to update all branches potentially receiving security updates to use the same workflow files for easier maintenance as much as possible. However, there are times when the logic found in GitHub Action workflow files changes pretty drastically.
    
    For PHPUnit testing, there are 2 instances where this occurred: the 5.2 and 5.9 branches. This changeset introduces 2 new reusable PHPUnit workflow files for use the 4.1-5.1 and 5.2-5.9 branches.
    
    Including these workflows in `trunk` makes it more clear which version of the workflow file is used by these old branches, and allows Dependabot to open PRs for updating 3rd-party actions within these workflows.

    HTML API: Report breadcrumbs properly when visiting virtual nodes.
    
    When [58304] introduced the abililty to visit virtual nodes in the HTML document,
    those being the nodes which are implied by the HTML but no explicitly present in
    the raw text, a bug was introduced in the `get_breadcrumbs()` method because it
    wasn't updated to be aware of the virtual nodes. Therefore it would report the
    wrong breadcrumbs for virtual nodes. Since the new `get_depth()` method is based
    on the same logic it was also broken for virtual nodes.
    
    In this patch, the breadcrumbs have been updated to account for the virtual nodes
    and the depth method has been updated to rely on the fixed breadcrumb logic.

    Script Modules: Add new API to embed server data in HTML.
    
    Add a new filter `script_module_data_{$module_id}` to associate data
    with a Script Module. For example:
    
    {{{#!php
    add_filter(
            'script_module_data_MyScriptModuleID',
            function ( array $data ): array {
                    $data['script-needs-this-data'] = 'ok';
                    return $data;
            }
    );
    }}}
    
    If the Script Module is included in the page, enqueued or as a
    dependency, the associated data will be JSON-encoded and embedded in the
    HTML in a `<script type="application/json">` tag with an ID of the form
    `wp-script-module-data-{$module_id}` allowing the Script Module to
    access the data on the client.

    Block Hooks: Refactor controller filter to use meta_input.
    
    Prior to this changeset, the function `update_ignored_hooked_blocks_postmeta()` used the core function `update_post_meta()` to write `_wp_ignored_hooked_blocks` data to the database during an operation that is preparing a post to be inserted.
    
    Since we have access to the incoming changes that are being prepared we can remove this database operation in favour of writing the data to the post object provided under `meta_input`.
    
    Doing this means two things:
    
    1. It allows us to store postmeta for new posts that are about to be created since they don't have an `ID` yet (which is information `update_post_meta()` needs).
    2. The core controller will take care of updating postmeta in a more predictable pattern.
